# XCHAIN CRYPTO

The XCHAIN CRYPTO package is a crypto package used by all `XCHAIN` clients.

XCHAIN-CRYPTO encrypts a master phrase to a keystore. This keystore can then be exported to other XCHAIN wallets or stored securely.

Users can export their phrase and import them into other wallets since it is a BIP39 compatible phrase.
